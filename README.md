# CS370-Current-Emerging-Trends
## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  The work that I did on this project was focused on implementing an algorithm, using deep Q-learning, to support an intelligent agent in learning to solve a maze. We were given starter code but given the task to develop the actual learning loop, training the AI over episodes of gameplay. The code I developed was based on psuedocode that goes through:
  * Resetting the game environment
  * Starting a gameplay loop
  * Taking a step either through exploration or exploitation
  * Storing wins, losses, and the environment state
  * Training the agent when the game is complete, evaluating wins and losses, and checking for win rate compared to the threshold for completion
    
## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
      Computer Scientists 'do' a huge range of things in many different positions. If we boil down the functions of a Computer Scientist to the most basic form, I would suggest simply that they, 'use technology to solve problems'. The technologies and the issues can vary drastically, but overall the task of a Computer Scientist is to use their technical expertise to solve real life problems. They are extremely important to our modern world as nearly everything we use daily is considered technology. As technlogy continues to advance, it is crucial for society to have individuals who understand how this technology works. Understanding these new technologies allow for them to continue improving, and also allow for problem solving of current issues. Computer Scientists are important in the same way mechanics are important. They both hold expertise in their fields, allowing for complex problem solving where a common individual likely couldn't.
     When I approach a problem as a computer scientist I consider every step I need to take to solve the problem. For example, if I need to add a feature to a program that changes volume when a button is hit I would break this into tiny steps. Firstly we need to know when a user hits a specific button, which I would then break down further into things like, "How do I track whether that button is pressed?" and "Do I need to know how long they press the button for?" Breaking problems down into steps like these has saved me future-me a lot of headaches in going back to address use cases I hadn't thought of originally. In the case of this project, developing an AI model algorithm using deep Q-learning to solve a maze was challenging. Rather than starting at the root of the problem solving, we were given starter code that I had to study and understand so I could add compatible code onto the already written code.
My ethical responsibilites, especially in the case of AI usage, are extremely important to consider. AI only knows what it is fed, so any interaction with human data is important to keep safe from AI reuse. My ethical responsibilities regarding users and companies are in keeping private information private, keeping all data secure, and also explaining the risk of AI making mistakes and potential damages of these mistakes.
